## Getting Started

First, install the packages:

```bash
npm install
```

and run with 

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Challenges and process
A very nice assignment, realistic and challenging assignment where I used Next and Tailwind for the first time. Gave me a lot of new insights. The process was as follows:

- Read requirements
- Setup and install (Tailwind, Next, TS/Lint) 
- Fetch and parse data
- Display products
- Build pagination
- Build filter (categories)
- Build filter (categories)

Things I still need to look in to:
- Build filter (price)
- Improve image performance
- Make pagination use dynamic routing
- Display categories and color filters more dynamically from the api
- Refactor
