## Getting Started

First, install the packages:

```bash
npm install
```

and run with 

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Challenges and process
A very nice, realistic and challenging assignment where I used Next and Tailwind for the first time. Gave me a lot of new insights and I learned a lot of new things. The process was as follows:

- Read requirements
- Setup and install (Tailwind, Next, TS/Lint) 
- Fetch and parse data
- Display products
- Improve image performance
  - This is something I looked into at a very early stage since the assignment puts a strong emphasis on this. Unfortunately I couldn't implement something to improve this in time. I decided to move forward and get the other stuff done first and look back at this when I have time left. (Should be server side rendered)
- Build pagination
  - Another challenge, since with a lot of api's, a page prop is provided. Which makes it easier to render next and previous pages. Initially I wanted to make the pagination have the same behaviour as on [toolbeer.dk](toolbeer.dk), but again, time :( 
- Build filter (categories)
- Build filter (colors)


Things I still need to look in to:
- Improve image performance
- Build filter (price)
- Make pagination use dynamic routing
- Display categories and color filters more dynamically from the api
- Refactor
